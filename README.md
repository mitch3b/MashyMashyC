# MashyMashyC
Rewriting Mashy Mashy in C to make new features easier

# Instructions
1. Follow instructions on https://nesdoug.com/ to setup cc65 (sorry I don't have more specific instructions).
2. Just run "make" to build the rom.

# Dev notes
Used Doug tutorial as the backbone for the project: https://nesdoug.com/

Most of my logic is in MashyMashy.c and a lot of the variables are defined in DEFINE.c. The work to translate from C to assembly (taken from the tutorials on nesdoug) are in reset.s.
